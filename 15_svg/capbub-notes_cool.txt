Sample 1
Hypothesis:
- When clicking a cell, an alert will be displayed


Conclusion:
- Hypothesis correct




Sample 2
Hypothesis:
- inner HTML will be in the order of table, tr, and then td
Conclusion:
- Order actually went like this: td, tr, table


Q: The order appears in td, tr, then table




Sample 3
Hypothesis:
-The same thing as Sample 2 will happen
Conclusion:
-The table comes first instead


Q: the uncommented line will stop the display of td and tr (no “true”)
Q: The order appears in Table, td, then tr


Sample 4
Hypothesis: 
- the order will return to td,tr,table
Conclusion: 
-Adding “true” to multiple event listeners reverses the order they are triggered 
-Adding a “true” to an event listener appears to prioritize it over those without a “true”, e.stopPropogation does not skip over “true”, it just allows the first event 


Q: the order the event listeners are added do not matter
